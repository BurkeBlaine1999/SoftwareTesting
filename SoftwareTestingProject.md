# <div align="center"> Test Plan </div>



## 1.0 INTRODUCTION

The product we are testing is called 'The Pixel Wizard'.
It is a 2D game inspired from games such as Shovel Knight and skyrim. In the game the player will play as a Pixel Wizard who will have to navigate his/her way through increasingly difficult levels featuring new enemies and boss stages. 

> The players weapon will be magic fireballs that they will shoot using Left mouse click or the R key. On mobile it will be done using a dedicated button.

> The player will have 5 HP meaning they can be hit 5 times before dying.

> Each level will have health pickups in order for the player to regenerate health increasing the players survivability.

> The player will be able to pause the game at any time and be able to edit game settings , exit , save and resume the game.

> The player will be able to move , jump and crouch using the generic 'WASD' controls. There will be dedicated buttons for the movement on the mobile verison.



## 2.0 OBJECTIVES AND TASKS
### 2.1 Objectives

We devided our team into small groups and assigned them all different tasks as listed in section 2.2. We will use microsoft teams and github to communicate and share work. With our service agreement we agreed to have it due by the end of 2020.

### 2.2 Tasks

There are several taks to be done in the project.

* Testing the UI to ensure it functions as expected.
* Testing the enemies in game to ensure they function as expected. e.g. Follow the player , Attack the player
* Post testing the game by releasing the game as a beta to the public , granting us user acceptance testing. This black box testing allows us to get more views on the game.
* Set up a bug reporting system for the beta in order to get feedback from the public.

## 3.0 SCOPE
### General

*In game..*

>Upon picking up health items the players health will be increased if not on full health.

>If the player touches an enemy or is hit by a projectile they will receive damage.

>If the player gets to 0 HP they will receive a Game over screen.

>The players controls will work as intended.

>Upon pressing the fire button the player will fire a fire ball projectile instantly.

*In Menus..*

>Game exits when 'Quit' button is selected.

>Music volume adjusts when lowered or raised.

>When the pause button is selected the game freezes and displays the UI.

>When the resume button is pressed the game resumes and the pause menu disapears.

>When the 'save game' button is selected the games state is saved and can be reloaded.

### Tactics

We will divided into two teams , one team taking in game testing and one taking in menu testing. We will then have daily scrum meetings to ensure progress is being made. We will use user acceptance testing  and white box testing methods as if a wider audience uses it we are more likely to find errors/bugs.

Tactics
List here how you will accomplish the items that you have listed in the "Scope" section. For
example, if you have mentioned that you will be testing the existing interfaces, what would be the
procedures you would follow to notify the key people to represent their respective areas, as well as
allotting time in their schedule for assisting you in accomplishing your activity?

## 4.0 TESTING STRATEGY

Our testing strategy is to attempt to rid the game of bugs/errors so we can release our game to the public and receive feedback.
We will be testing all the main aspects and functions of the game as stated in the scope (3.0).

We will be using several types of testing such as Unit Testing , System and Integration Testing ,Performance and Stress Testing,User Acceptance Testing , Batch Testing,Automated Regression Testing,Beta Testing Participants.

### 4.1 Unit Testing



Definition:
Specify the minimum degree of comprehensiveness desired. Identify the techniques which will be
used to judge the comprehensiveness of the testing effort (for example, determining which
statements have been executed at least once). Specify any additional completion criteria (for
example, error frequency). The techniques to be used to trace requirements should be specified.
Participants:
List the names of individuals/departments who would be responsible for Unit Testing.
Methodology:
Describe how unit testing will be conducted, including a description of tests to be carried out. Who
will write the test scripts for the unit testing, what would be the sequence of events of Unit Testing
and how will the testing activity take place?
### 4.2 System and Integration Testing
Definition:
List what is your understanding of System and Integration Testing for your project.
Participants:
Who will be conducting System and Integration Testing on your project? List the individuals that will
be responsible for this activity.
Methodology:
Describe how System & Integration testing will be conducted, including a description of tests to be
carried out Who will write the test scripts for the unit testing, what would be sequence of events of
System & Integration Testing, and how will the testing activity take place?
### 4.3 Performance and Stress Testing
Definition:
List what is your understanding of Stress Testing for your project.
Participants:
Who will be conducting Stress Testing on your project? List the individuals that will be responsible
for this activity.
Methodology:
Describe how Performance & Stress testing will be conducted, including a description of tests to be
carried out Who will write the test scripts for the testing, what would be sequence of events of
Performance & Stress Testing, and how will the testing activity take place? 
### 4.4 User Acceptance Testing
Definition:
The purpose of acceptance test is to confirm that the system is ready for operational use. During
acceptance test, end-users (customers) of the system compare the system to its initial requirements.
Participants:
Who will be responsible for User Acceptance Testing? List the individuals' names and responsibility.
Methodology:
Describe how the User Acceptance testing will be conducted, including a description of tests to be
carried out Who will write the test scripts for the testing, what would be sequence of events of User
Acceptance Testing, and how will the testing activity take place?
### 4.5 Batch Testing
### 4.6 Automated Regression Testing
Definition:
Regression testing is the selective retesting of a system or component to verify that modifications
have not caused unintended effects and that the system or component still works as specified in the
requirements.
Participants:
Methodology:
### 4.7 Beta Testing Participants:
Methodology:




## 5.0 TEST SCHEDULE
Include test milestones identified in the Software Project Schedule as well as all item transmittal
events.
Define any additional test milestones needed. Estimate the time required to do each testing task.
Specify the schedule for each testing task and test milestone. For each testing resource (that is,
facilities, tools, and staff), specify its periods of use.



## 6.0 CONTROL PROCEDURES
Problem Reporting
Document the procedures to follow when an incident is encountered during the testing process. If a
standard form is going to be used, attach a blank copy as an "Appendix" to the Test Plan. In the
event you are using an automated incident logging system, write those procedures in this section.
Change Requests
Document the process of modifications to the software. Identify who will sign off on the changes
and what would be the criteria for including the changes to the current product. If the changes will
affect existing programs, these modules need to be identified.



## 7.0 FEATURES TO BE TESTED
Identify all software features and combinations of software features that will be tested.



## 8.0 FEATURES NOT TO BE TESTED
Identify all features and significant combinations of features which will not be tested and the
reasons.



## 9.0 RESOURCES/ROLES & RESPONSIBILITIES
Specify the staff members who are involved in the test project and what their roles are going to be
(for example, Mary Brown (User) compile Test Cases for Acceptance Testing). Identify groups
responsible for managing, designing, preparing, executing, and resolving the test activities as well as
related issues. Also identify groups responsible for providing the test environment. These groups
may include developers, testers, operations staff, testing services, etc.



## 10.0 SCHEDULES
Identify the deliverable documents. You can list the following documents:
- Test Plan
- Test Cases
- Test Incident Reports
- Test Summary Reports


## 11.0 RISKS/ASSUMPTIONS
Identify the high-risk assumptions of the test plan. Specify contingency plans for each (for example,
delay in delivery of test items might require increased night shift scheduling to meet the delivery
date).


## 12.0 TOOLS
List the Automation tools you are going to use. List also the Bug tracking tool here.
